1	When you get what you want in your struggle for self
2	And the world makes you king for a day.
3	Just go to a mirror and look at yourself
4	And see what that man has to say.
5	For it is not your father, your mother or your wife
6	Whose judgement upon you must pass.
7	But the fellow's verdict who counts most in your life is the man
8	Looking back from the glass.
9	Some people may say you are a square-shooting chum
10	And call you a wonderful guy.
11	But the man in the glass says you're only a bum,
12	If you can't look him straight in the eye.
13	He is the one to please, never mind the rest,
14	For he's with your clear up until the end.
15	And you will pass your most dangerous and difficult test
16	If the man in the glass is your friend.
17	You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years
18	And get pats on your back as you pass.
19	But your final reward will be heartache and tears
20	If you've cheated the man in the glass.
